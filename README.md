# R-exercises

This repository contains my notes about the R language and the solutions to the exercises from the Statistics and Data Analysis lab at the Computer Science degree at Unimi.

Exercises are taken (and traslated) from this [website](http://frasca.di.unimi.it/stat15/stat.html).

You're free to contribute, adding or correcting (more plausible) what I've done. 

Thus feel free to fork and insult me if I've done nasty sh*t ;)
