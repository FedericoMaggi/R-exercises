# R-exercises

This repository contains my notes about the R language and the solutions to the exercises from the Statistics and Data Analysis lab at the Computer Science course at [UNIMI](http://unimi.it).

Exercises are taken (and traslated) from this [website](http://frasca.di.unimi.it/stat15/stat.html).
